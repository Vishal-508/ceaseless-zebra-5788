**Introduction**
---
ESPN cricinfo  is a sports news website exclusively for the game of cricket. The site features news, articles, live coverage of cricket matches including liveblogs and scorecards, and StatsGuru, a database of historical matches and players from the 18th century to the present.
CricInfo was launched on 15 March 1993 by Simon King, a British researcher at the University of Minnesota. It grew with help from students and researchers at universities around the world. Contrary to some reports, Badri Seshadri, who was very instrumental in CricInfo's early growth, did not become involved in CricInfo until some months after its founding.
